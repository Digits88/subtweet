00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,755
I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:17,600
Shit!

178
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,996
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,753
I can't do this.

180
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,433
Shit.

181
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:53,528
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,491
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,868
...two lives.

184
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,789
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,375
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

186
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,713
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,423
And you...

188
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:18,637
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,268
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,521
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:32,567
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,822
One of these lives...

193
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,906
...has a future.

194
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,242
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:47,791
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,127
You're here...

197
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,712
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,345
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

199
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,388
...individual.

200
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,352
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,356
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,026
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,320
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,241
My colleagues...

205
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,619
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

206
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,332
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

207
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,127
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,630
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,049
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

210
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:41,804
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,432
Yeah.

212
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,809
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,189
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,940
How about...

215
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,358
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,947
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,992
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,207
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,084
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,711
I know my rights.

221
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,462
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,215
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,509
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,346
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,340
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,009
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,724
[PHONE RINGS]

228
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:04,696
MORPHEUS: <i>This line is tapped,</i>
<i>so I must be brief.</i>

229
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:09,242
<i>They got to you first, but they've</i>
<i>underestimated how important you are.</i>

230
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,328
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

231
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:13,580
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

232
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,294
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

233
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:23,382
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have</i>
<i>spent the last few years...</i>

234
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,594
<i>...Iooking for me, but I've spent</i>
<i>my entire life...</i>

235
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,346
<i>...Iooking for you.</i>

236
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,057
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

237
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,894
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

238
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,323
Get in.

239
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,419
What's this?

240
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,213
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

241
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:05,633
- From what?
- From you.

242
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,635
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

243
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,970
Stop the car.

244
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:15,726
Listen, coppertop.

245
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,978
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

246
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,855
Right now, there's only one rule:

247
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:22,482
Our way...

248
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:23,901
...or the highway.

249
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,534
Fine.

250
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,871
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

251
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:39,083
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

252
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,042
You know that road.

253
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,671
You know exactly where it ends.

254
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,134
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

255
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,857
Apoc, lights.

256
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,528
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,700
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

258
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,916
Try and relax.

259
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,383
Come on.

260
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,469
Come on.

261
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,221
It's on the move.

262
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,223
Come on, you shit.

263
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,311
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

264
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,563
Clear!

265
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,281
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

266
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,358
This is it.

267
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,155
Let me give you one piece of advice.

268
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,784
Be honest.

269
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,578
He knows more than you can imagine.

270
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,631
At last.

271
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:53,259
Welcome, Neo.

272
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,386
As you no doubt have guessed...

273
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:57,887
...I am Morpheus.

274
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,516
It's an honor to meet you.

275
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,017
No...

276
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,894
...the honor is mine.

277
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,314
Please, come. Sit.

278
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,038
I imagine...

279
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,209
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

280
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,337
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

281
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,257
You could say that.

282
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,801
I can see it in your eyes.

283
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:40,681
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

284
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,182
...because he's expecting to wake up.

285
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,186
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

286
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:50,273
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

287
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,525
No.

288
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,984
Why not?

289
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,029
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

290
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,451
I know exactly what you mean.

291
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,124
Let me tell you why you're here.

292
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,710
You know something.

293
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,878
What you know,
you can't explain.

294
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,963
But you feel it.

295
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:16,467
You felt it your entire life:

296
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:21,221
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

297
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,932
Like a splinter in your mind...

298
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,059
...driving you mad.

299
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,730
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

300
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,108
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

301
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,278
The Matrix?

302
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:41,450
Do you want to know...

303
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,911
...what it is?

304
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,164
The Matrix is everywhere.

305
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,125
It is all around us.

306
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,336
Even now, in this very room.

307
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,381
You can see it when you
look out your window...

308
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,965
...or when you turn on your television.

309
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,928
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:04,138
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,642
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,688
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,522
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:15,983
What truth?

315
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,781
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,576
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:30,499
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,084
A prison...

319
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,460
...for your mind.

320
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,802
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,513
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,853
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,655
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:05,241
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,161
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:10,538
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,583
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,167
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,377
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,589
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,683
Remember...

332
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,563
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,203
Follow me.

334
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,415
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,042
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,423
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,299
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,194
- You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,326
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:34,705
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,290
What does that mean?

342
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,044
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:40,711
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,005
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,295
Did you...?

346
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,393
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,439
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,191
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,234
...and the real world?

350
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,029
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,239
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,450
Be real?

353
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,829
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,039
Still nothing.

355
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,833
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,460
It's cold!

357
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,007
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,178
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,887
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:17,601
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,354
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:18,697
Welcome...

363
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:20,951
...to the real world.

364
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:24,204
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:25,996
We found him.

366
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:29,041
- I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:31,210
I know it.

368
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,425
Am I dead?

369
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,094
Far from it.

370
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,485
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:57,028 --> 00:35:58,112
What are you doing?

372
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,574
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,701
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,286
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,083
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,001
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,240
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,161
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,871
What is this place?

380
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,791
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,333
"When"?

382
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,585
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:39,088
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,967
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,844
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,181
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:51,184
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,478
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,690
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,277
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,284
This is the core...

392
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,541
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,088
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:27,512
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,639
...Switch...

396
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:32,391
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,353
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,648
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:47,239
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,492
Trinity.

401
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,097
Try to relax.

402
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,813
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,159
This...

404
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,036
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:36,581
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:39,291
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,918
...to equipment...

408
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,545
...weapons...

409
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,005
...training simulations...

410
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,925
...anything we need.

411
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,139
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:55,349
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,478
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,773
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:05,485
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

416
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,822
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:15,829
This isn't real?

418
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,621
What is "real"?

419
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,250
How do you define "real"?

420
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,460
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,130
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,259
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,849
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,311
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,025
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,527
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:55,869
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,996
This is the world...

429
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,039
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:16,054
Welcome to "the desert...

431
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,516
...of the real."

432
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,271
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,318
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

434
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:31,820
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,826
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,744
AI.

437
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,164
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:45,835
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,130
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:53,760
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,597
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:57,847 --> 00:42:01,184
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,021
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:10,150
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,822
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,456
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:27,835
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,922
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:37,094
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,893
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:48,398
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,942
We are grown.

453
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,576
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,494
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,456
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,043
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:13,840
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,010
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:21,431
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,682
Control.

461
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,438
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,317
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,653
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,447
...into this.

465
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:40,949
No.

466
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:44,161
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,746
It's not possible.

468
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:50,918
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,461
Stop!

470
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,213
Let me out!

471
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:56,840
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,471
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,389
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,684
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,561
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,480
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,398
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,150
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,443
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,903
Just breathe.

481
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:38,090
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:40,342
No.

483
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:42,387
But if you could...

484
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,722
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,601
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,561
We have a rule.

487
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,273
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,525
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,943
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,487
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,615
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,784
...I had to.

493
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,297
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:18,798 --> 00:45:22,592
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:25,887
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,101
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:33,603
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,150
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,570
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:46,324
After he died...

501
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,786
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:53,541
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,460
...end the war...

504
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,043
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,009
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:04,927
...Iooking for him.

507
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,431
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,186
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,692
Get some rest.

510
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:22,110
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:25,864
For what?

512
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,119
Your training.

513
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:50,139
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,224
You will tonight.

515
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,143
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,563
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,440
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,072
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:07,532
Born free right here...

520
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:09,407
...in the real world.

521
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:11,327
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:14,621
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,373
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,083
It's a city?

525
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,503
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,340
Where is it?

527
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:29,512
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,014
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:40,106
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,108
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:45,360
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,028
...if you are...

533
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:50,115
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,869
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,710
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:05,172
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,965
How about...

538
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,302
...combat training?

539
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,809
"Jujitsu"?

540
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:20,353
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:32,909
Holy shit!

542
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,494
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

543
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,121
How about some more?

544
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:38,664
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,791
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,056
How is he?

547
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:57,474
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,070
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:12,739
Show me.

550
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,284
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,329
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,916
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:25,628
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,672
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,340
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,967
Understand?

557
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:34,094
Then hit me...

558
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,804
...if you can.

559
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:15,844
Good!

560
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,762
Adaptation.

561
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,264
Improvisation.

562
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:20,891
But your weakness...

563
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,518
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,568
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:45,016
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,690
You're too fast.

567
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,568
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,445
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:01,367
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,206
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:21,929
Again!

572
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,818
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:38,278
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:43,742 --> 00:52:45,202
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:47,413
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:51,833
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,751
Know you are.

578
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,931
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,610
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,280
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:26,117
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:28,536
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:30,956
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,460
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,766
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:52,478
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:56,356
Free your mind.

588
00:54:04,615 --> 00:54:05,740
Whoa.

589
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:14,250
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:17,503
Free my mind.

591
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,088
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:22,048
- No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,844
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,512
Come on.

595
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,931
All right.

596
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,432
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:35,019
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,083
What does that mean?

599
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,293
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,463
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:03,215
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:26,530
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,036
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:32,202 --> 00:55:33,244
...you die here?

605
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,331
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,199
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,121
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,373
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,583
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,505
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:25,422 --> 00:56:28,342
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,686
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:41,438 --> 00:56:42,731
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,692
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:49,737
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:52,782
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,994
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,163
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,539
You have to understand...

620
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,126
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,961
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,630
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,592
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:15,847
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:16,014 --> 00:57:17,766
- I was--
- Look again.

626
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,101
Freeze it.

627
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:28,360
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,990
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,034
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,371
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:45,418
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,172
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,840
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,635
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:55,929
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,972
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,351
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,228
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,440
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,525
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:10,902
Someone?

642
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,653
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:17,951
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:20,579
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:21,829
Why?

646
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,373
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,211
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:33,090
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:34,467
Because of that...

650
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,096
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

651
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,268
What are you telling me?

652
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:46,438
That I can dodge bullets?

653
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,815
No, Neo.

654
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,237
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

655
00:58:54,112 --> 00:58:55,447
...you won't have to.

656
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:58,282
[PHONE RINGS]

657
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,786

- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

659
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,728
Shit.

660
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,856
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

661
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:33,277
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

662
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:34,735
Search and destroy.

663
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,239
Set her down there.

664
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,012
How are we doing, Tank?

- ...and ready.
- EMP?

668
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:16,612
Electromagnetic pulse.

669
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:19,739
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

670
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,199
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

NEO: Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

672
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,503
Sewers.

673
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,422
TRINITY: There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

674
01:00:36,923 --> 01:00:38,842
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

675
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,427
Quiet.

676
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,469
Whoa! Neo.

677
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:26,472
You scared the bejesus out of me.

678
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:29,476
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

679
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:33,230
Is that...?

680
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,065
The Matrix?

681
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,440
Yeah.

682
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:41,405
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

683
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:44,740
The image translators work
for the construct program.

684
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:48,411
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

685
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,623
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

01:01:51,873 --> 01:01:55,293
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,213
...want a drink?

689
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,507
Sure.

690
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:05,512
You know...

691
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,972
...I know what you're thinking.

692
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,307
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

693
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,978
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

694
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,900

698
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,376
It's good for two things:

01:02:36,626 --> 01:02:39,713
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

700
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,923
So can I ask you something?

701
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,554
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:52,016
Why you're here?

So you're here to save the world.

01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,365
What do you say
to something like that?

707
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,914
A little piece of advice.

708
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:18,126
You see an agent...

709
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,753

01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,630

01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,715
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,682
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:38,396 --> 01:03:39,563
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:43,568 --> 01:03:46,987
SMITH:
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,782
You know...

716
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,661
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,414
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

718
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,751
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

719
01:04:00,043 --> 01:04:01,168
...juicy...

720
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:03,170
...and delicious.

721
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,342
After nine years...

722
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:09,927
...you know what I realize?

723
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:18,978
Ignorance is bliss.

724
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:25,860
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,282
I don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:33,034
Nothing. You understand?

727
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,914
And I want to be rich.

728
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,960
You know, someone important.

729
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,588
Like an actor.

730
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:49,925
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

731
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,637
Okay.

732
01:04:54,014 --> 01:04:56,432
You get my body
back in a power plant...

733
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,559
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

734
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:00,311
...I'll get you what you want.

735
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,563
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

736
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,983
No. I told you, I don't know them.

737
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,945
I can get you the man who does.

738
01:05:10,697 --> 01:05:12,489
Morpheus.

739
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,045
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

740
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,175
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

741
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,092
Or a bowl of snot.

742
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,219
MOUSE:
You know what it reminds me of?

743
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:38,391
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

744
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,726
No, but technically,
neither did you.

745
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,021
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

746
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,648
Because you have to wonder...

747
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:48,150
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

748
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,818
Maybe they got it wrong.

749
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,280
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

750
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,574
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

751
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,786
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

752
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,039
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

753
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:03,333
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

754
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:05,376
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

755
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:08,463
DOZER:
It's a single-celled protein...

756
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:11,757
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

757
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,259
Everything the body needs.

758
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,387
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

759
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,226
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

760
01:06:23,269 --> 01:06:25,313
You know, I wrote that program.

761
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,898
Here it comes.

762
01:06:27,148 --> 01:06:29,108
MOUSE: What did you think of her?
NEO: Of who?

763
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,528
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

764
01:06:32,862 --> 01:06:35,614
She doesn't talk very much...

765
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:39,827
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

766
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,454
The digital pimp hard at work.

767
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,956
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

768
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,085
To deny our own impulses...

769
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:50,463
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

770
01:06:52,382 --> 01:06:53,757
Dozer, when you're done...

771
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:55,552
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

772
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,469
We're going in.

773
01:06:58,179 --> 01:06:59,597
I'm taking Neo to see her.

774
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:04,768
See who?

775
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,021
The Oracle.

776
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,070
Everyone please observe...

777
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,114
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

778
01:07:17,615 --> 01:07:20,994
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

779
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:23,038
[PHONE RINGS]

780
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,436
We're in.

781
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:03,244
We'll be back in an hour.

782
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:09,291
[PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]

783
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,011
MORPHEUS:
Unbelievable...

784
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:21,595
...isn't it?

785
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,018
NEO: God!
- What?

786
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:29,061
I used to eat there.

787
01:08:31,314 --> 01:08:32,940
Really good noodles.

788
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,239
I have these memories from my life.

789
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,368
None of them happened.

790
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,328
What does that mean?

791
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:48,789
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

792
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:50,917
But an oracle can?

793
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,585
That's different.

794
01:08:57,298 --> 01:08:58,550
Did you go to her?

795
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,261
TRINITY:
Yes.

796
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:03,137
What did she tell you?

797
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:07,891
She told me...

798
01:09:08,935 --> 01:09:10,103
What?

799
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,233
MORPHEUS:
We're here.

800
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,902
Neo, come with me.

801
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:40,300
So is this the same oracle
that made...

802
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:41,717
...the prophecy?

803
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:46,305
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

804
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,765
NEO: The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

805
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,395
And she knows what? Everything?

806
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,358
She would say she knows enough.

807
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:00,278
And she's never wrong.

808
01:10:02,488 --> 01:10:05,658
MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

809
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,577
She is a guide, Neo.

810
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,828
She can help you to find the path.

811
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,581
She helped you?

812
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,332
Yes.

813
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:15,417
What did she tell you?

814
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,088
That I would find the One.

815
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,354
I told you I can only
show you the door.

816
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,149
You have to walk through it.

817
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:43,029
Hello, Neo.

818
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:44,948
You're right on time.

819
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:56,667
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

820
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,925
These are the other Potentials.

821
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:05,717
You can wait here.

822
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:49,095
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

823
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,596
That's impossible.

824
01:11:52,432 --> 01:11:56,435
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

825
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,354
What truth?

826
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:00,273
There is no spoon.

827
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:04,193
There is no spoon?

828
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:08,905
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

829
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:26,423
The Oracle will you see now.

830
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,685
ORACLE:
I know you're Neo.

831
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,479
Be right with you.

832
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,899
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

833
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,488
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

834
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,699
Almost done.

835
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:56,828
Smell good, don't they?

836
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,332
Yeah.

837
01:12:59,582 --> 01:13:01,417
ORACLE:
I'd ask you to sit down...

838
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,045
...but you're not going to anyway.

839
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,422
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

840
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:11,719
That vase.

841
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:13,720
I'm sorry.

842
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:15,847
I said, don't worry about it.

843
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:18,975
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

844
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:20,811
How did you know?

845
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:26,650
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

846
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:29,945
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

847
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,661
You're cuter than I thought.

848
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,957
I can see why she likes you.

849
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,917
Who?

850
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,002
Not too bright, though.

851
01:13:49,298 --> 01:13:52,385
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

852
01:13:54,512 --> 01:13:55,680
So...

853
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,015
...what do you think?

854
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:01,601
Do you think you are the One?

855
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,604
I don't know.

856
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:09,444
You know what that means?

857
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,445
It's Latin.

858
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,030
Means, "Know thyself."

859
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,452
I'll let you in on a little secret.

860
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:23,541
Being the One is just
like being in love.

861
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,127
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

862
01:14:27,378 --> 01:14:28,503
...through and through.

863
01:14:28,838 --> 01:14:30,881
Balls to bones.

864
01:14:33,217 --> 01:14:34,260
Well...

865
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,305
...I'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,141
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

867
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,199
Okay...

868
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:02,787
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

869
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:04,414
Then you say:

870
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:06,292
But what?

871
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:10,505
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

872
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:14,884
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

873
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,512
You got the gift...

874
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,724
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

875
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:27,438
What?

876
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,565
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

877
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,402
That's the way these things go.

878
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,863
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

879
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,036
He almost had me convinced.

880
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,412
I know.

881
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,082
Poor Morpheus.

882
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,587
Without him, we're lost.

883
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:56,300
What do you mean, "without him"?

884
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,222
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

885
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:07,185
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

886
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:11,064
And no one, not you, not even me...

887
01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,568
...can convince him otherwise.

888
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:16,319
He believes it so blindly...

889
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:20,949
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

890
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:22,326

01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,876
You first.

1068
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:16,386
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1069
01:31:19,181 --> 01:31:20,347
Dozer?

1070
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,993
SMITH:
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1071
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,997
Marveled at its beauty...

1072
01:31:45,373 --> 01:31:47,626
...its genius?

1073
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:50,670
Billions of people...

1074
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,672
...just living out their lives.

1075
01:31:54,716 --> 01:31:56,384
Oblivious.

1076
01:32:00,972 --> 01:32:03,850
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1077
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,771
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1078
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,192
...where everyone would be happy.

1079
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,235
It was a disaster.

1080
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:18,823
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1081
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:21,451
Some believe that...

1082
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:26,081
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1083
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:27,873
But I believe that...

1084
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,208
...as a species...

1085
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:33,296
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1086
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:34,922
...and suffering.

1087
01:32:35,173 --> 01:32:37,884
So the perfect world was a dream...

1088
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:42,972
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1089
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:47,978
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1090
01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:49,938
The peak...

1091
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,605
...of your civilization.

1092
01:32:51,856 --> 01:32:54,109
I say, "your civilization"...

1093
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:58,488
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1094
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:01,824
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1095
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:05,744
Evolution, Morpheus.

1096
01:33:06,037 --> 01:33:07,372
Evolution.

1097
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,542
Like the dinosaur.

1098
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:15,337
Look out that window.

1099
01:33:16,047 --> 01:33:18,173
You had your time.

1100
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,804
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1101
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,515
The future is our time.

1102
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,936
There could be a problem.

1103
01:33:31,855 --> 01:33:35,233
NEO: What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1104
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,652
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1105
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:39,112
How much time?

1106
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:42,489
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1107
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:47,162
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1108
01:33:47,412 --> 01:33:50,372
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1109
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,666
What do they want?

1110
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:55,962
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1111
01:33:56,212 --> 01:33:59,131
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1112
01:33:59,382 --> 01:34:02,469
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1113
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,887
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1114
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,221
...or you...

1115
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:07,681
...or even Morpheus.

1116
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,145
There has to be
something we can do.

1117
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:15,564
There is. We pull the plug.

1118
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,403
You're going to kill him?

1119
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:21,820
Kill Morpheus?

1120
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:24,073
We don't have a choice.

1121
01:34:30,872 --> 01:34:33,792
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1122
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:35,793
If the insider has failed...

1123
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:39,255
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1124
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:41,216
They're dead. In either case--

1125
01:34:41,466 --> 01:34:45,011
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1126
01:34:45,261 --> 01:34:46,345
Immediately.

1127
01:34:51,601 --> 01:34:54,270
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1128
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:57,439
You were a father.

1129
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,944
We'll miss you always.

1130
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,034
Stop!

1131
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:11,537
I don't believe this is happening.

1132
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,747
- Neo, this has to be done.
NEO: Does it?

1133
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:15,917
I don't know.

1134
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,712
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1135
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:20,171
NEO:
The Oracle.

1136
01:35:20,422 --> 01:35:22,215
She told me this would happen.

1137
01:35:22,632 --> 01:35:26,802
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:28,470
What choice?

1139
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:33,976
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:36,645
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:36,855 --> 01:35:40,483
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:42,652
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,488
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,033
What?

1145
01:35:49,743 --> 01:35:51,368
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,706
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:57,625
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:58,293 --> 01:35:59,543
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:00,128 --> 01:36:02,756
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:07,177 --> 01:36:10,512
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:15,143
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:20,355
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,192
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:23,400
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:23,652 --> 01:36:26,029
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:27,113 --> 01:36:30,824
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:34,078
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,872
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,666
What?

1160
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:41,085
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:58,061 --> 01:36:59,979
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:02,273
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1163
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:05,568
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:06,069 --> 01:37:08,445
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:13,076
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:15,369
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,497
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,667
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,627
Tank...

1170
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:24,921
...Ioad us up.

1171
01:37:34,556 --> 01:37:37,850
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,810
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:44,064
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:44,315 --> 01:37:46,568
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,112
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:53,783
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:59,037
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:01,123
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,211
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:09,966
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,385
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:12,677 --> 01:38:15,637
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,938
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:26,149
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:26,774 --> 01:38:28,443
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:30,653
A virus.

1187
01:38:31,988 --> 01:38:35,033
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:35,408 --> 01:38:36,951
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:39,328
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,288
And we...

1191
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:42,832
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,251
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:45,877 --> 01:38:47,002
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:48,796
Guns.

1195
01:38:49,631 --> 01:38:50,840
Lots of guns.

1196
01:39:00,725 --> 01:39:01,935
Neo...

1197
01:39:03,686 --> 01:39:06,229
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1198
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,359
That's why it's going to work.

1199
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:15,364
Why isn't the serum working?

1200
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,283
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1201
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,621
Leave me with him.

1202
01:39:24,207 --> 01:39:25,332
Now.

1203
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:38,136
TANK:
Hold on, Morpheus.

1204
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,099
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1205
01:39:43,476 --> 01:39:45,603
SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1206
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,523
I'm going to be honest...

1207
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:50,108
...with you.

1208
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,904
I...

1209
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:57,907
...hate...

1210
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,118
...this place...

1211
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,744
...this zoo...

1212
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,122
...this prison...

1213
01:40:04,372 --> 01:40:07,542
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1214
01:40:07,792 --> 01:40:10,086
I can't stand it any longer.

1215
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:12,713
It's the smell.

1216
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,966
If there is such a thing.

1217
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:19,595
I feel saturated by it.

1218
01:40:21,097 --> 01:40:22,390
I can...

1219
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,182
...taste...

1220
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,394
...your stink.

1221
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:30,273
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1222
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,440
It's repulsive.

1223
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:33,818
Isn't it?

1224
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,280
I must get out of here.

1225
01:40:38,698 --> 01:40:40,908
I must get free.

1226
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:44,037
And in this mind is the key.

1227
01:40:44,287 --> 01:40:45,954
My key.

1228
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:49,082
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1229
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:50,960
Do you understand?

1230
01:40:51,252 --> 01:40:52,627
I need the codes.

1231
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,213
I have to get inside Zion...

1232
01:40:55,548 --> 01:40:58,051
...and you have to tell me how.

1233
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:00,344
You're going to tell me...

1234
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:02,764
...or you're going to die.

1235
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:26,078
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1236
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,042
Holy shit!

1237
01:41:43,137 --> 01:41:45,847
Backup. Send backup.

1238
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,789
Freeze!

1239
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,841
What were you doing?

1240
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:29,970
